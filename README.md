The added methods for the banking system are used to save and load different types of transactions and account information from a database. The saveStudentAccount method makes sure that the details of a student account, which include his or her name, program, loan statement, PIN, bank ID, and email, are saved in the database correctly. If the account has already been created, it loads the existing record rather than creating a duplicate. The deleteBankFromDatabase and deleteMultipleBanksFromDatabase methods manage deleting banks from the system, one at a time or in multiples, which can be used for dealing with out-of-date or redundant banks. The transaction-loading methods—loadDepositTransaction, loadFundTransaction, loadPaymentTransaction, loadRecompenseTransaction, and loadWithdrawTransaction—each load particular kinds of transactions associated with an account. They are intended to retrieve transaction histories from related tables in the database, generating a complete record of deposits, fund transfers, payments, refunds, and withdrawals for user accounts. This design facilitates easy organization and rendering of transaction histories to users upon demand. In contrast, the methods responsible for saving transactions—save, savePayment, saveFund, saveRecompense, and saveWithdraw—are tasked with storing new transactions into the database. Each of these methods guarantees the creation of the right table if not already present, and then inserts the new transaction information into the respective table. This classification of transactions into various tables enables organization and quicker access when required. The presence of these methods is essential for the system to keep persistent storage of user information and return correct transaction histories. They also facilitate core operations such as deleting redundant data, adding new accounts, modifying existing accounts, and classifying transactions to be easily accessed. Moreover, employing prepared statements for SQL operations guarantees data security and integrity. Overall, these techniques help make the banking system scalable, efficient, and robust.
